# The Importance of Road Networks in Kyrgyzstan’s Landslide-Prone Terrain

Kyrgyzstan, located in Central Asia, is known for its rugged mountainous landscape, with more than 90% of the country covered by mountains. While the scenery is stunning, the terrain presents significant challenges, especially when it comes to landslides. As of 2009, approximately 5,000 areas have been identified as potentially prone to landslides, which continue to pose a risk to both human life and infrastructure.

One of the most vulnerable aspects of Kyrgyzstan’s infrastructure is its road network. These roads are crucial for connecting rural and urban areas and providing access to essential services such as healthcare, trade, and emergency response. Landslides can block these vital routes, cutting off communities and delaying aid in times of need. Therefore, understanding the risks to these roads and finding ways to address them is key to ensuring a timely response to such events.

## What Makes Roads Susceptible to Landslides?

Landslides are influenced by a combination of geological, topographical, and climatic factors. The type of soil, slope angles, and vegetation cover, along with rainfall patterns and seismic activity, all contribute to landslide risk. Roads are often built in valleys that face a high susceptibility of landslides.

## Taking a Proactive Approach

A proactive approach, known as anticipatory action, can help reduce the impact of landslides. By relying on forecasts and early warnings, preemptive actions—such as evacuations, reinforcing infrastructure, and pre-positioning emergency supplies—can save lives and reduce damage. Forecast-Based Financing (FbF) supports this approach by ensuring that funds are available for these measures based on weather and geohazard predictions.

## The Study

Using GIS and open-source data, we were able to create a high-resolution map of areas prone to landslides. With a Multicriteria Decision Making Analysis we were able to compute a variety of factors which contribute to landslide susceptibility. This susceptibility map can help guide planning and resource allocation, making preparedness efforts more efficient and effective.

## Outlook

As Kyrgyzstan continues to address the challenges posed by its mountainous geography, combining technology, proactive planning, and smart investments will be essential to reduce the impact of landslides. The growing efforts to map landslide risk are a significant step toward building a more resilient infrastructure, allowing the country to better prepare for future challenges and protect its communities.
